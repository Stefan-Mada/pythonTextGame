# Deus Ex Chamuel
Interactive Text Game for Honors 2103.

Some sort of meta comedy on the Romance genre, starring characters from a ride array of places....

## How to download
To download this game, you must download it from [this link](https://github.com/Stefan-Mada/pythonTextGame/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).


If that does not work, go to the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Stefan-Mada/pythonTextGame). 
Navigate to the green "Code" button roughly in the top right of the main
page, click on it, and click "Download ZIP."

## How to install and run
Once downloaded, you must unzip the file. On Mac, simply double-clicking
a zip file will typically do this. Then, you must double-click the
`runGame.command` file in order to run the game.

If this command says something along the lines of `python3 not found`, or
something similar, please download [this file](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-macos11.pkg),
which is the python installer for Mac OS. Then install python using this file.
If after installing this file, the game still does not run, please contact me
as soon as possible.

## Possible issues
When attempting to run the file, the operating system attempts to protect
the user from malicious code, and will often not let you run files from 
untrusted sources. I promise my code is safe, so please enable the code to
run, despite the operating system trying to protect you.

### Other contributors
Very thankful for my girlfriend testing my game to make sure it runs on a Mac,
as I myself don't have one to test it.

### Miscellaneous Items
This game took a surprising `23` hours to create!
