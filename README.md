# Python Text Game [name todo]
Interactive Text Game for Honors 2103.

Some sort of meta attempted comedy on the Romance genre, starring characters from a ride array of places....

## Where to download
To download this game, you must either have downloaded a ZIP file from
some source, such as an assignment submission, or you can download it from
the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Stefan-Mada/pythonTextGame). 
Navigate to the green "Code" button roughly in the top right of the main
page, click on it, and click "Download ZIP."

## How to install and run
Once downloaded, you must unzip the file. On Mac, simply double-clicking
a zip file will typically do this. Then, you must double-click the
`runGame.command` file in order to run the game.

There are several possible issues that can occur that I can not directly
address, as mac comes with different software depending on the version
of the operating system, and therefore runs slightly differently. I have made
a variety of files that should be able to address most scenarios, however. If
`runGame.command` does not work, go inside the `additional_scripts` folder
and try running `runGame2.command`. If that does not work, try running
`runGame3.command`. If it still does not work, run `install_python.command`
and follow the prompts. If this file does not run properly, try `install_python2.command`.
After this, run all of the runGame commands one more time. If it still does not
work, please reach out to me immediately to resolve this.

Once one of the game running files works, please use that specific file
to continue starting up the game.

## Possible issues
When attempting to run the file, the operating system attempts to protect
the user from malicious code, and will often not let you run files from 
untrusted sources. I promise my code is safe, so please enable the code to
run, despite the operating system trying to protect you.
